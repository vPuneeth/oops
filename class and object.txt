object oriented programming system/structure.
class -- compile time
object -- run time
object -- multiple copies of class or instance of a class.
class-- is a basic design or a blueprint that contains states or properties, variables behaviours.
behaviour -- methods ..

syntax of creating an object -(for instance variable only)
                                                    ClassName refrenceVariable = new ClasssName ();
                                                        refrenceVariable.variableName= --- ;
eg.-- pen
instance variables gets placed inside objects while static outside objects.
object is hold by refrence variable and gets resided in java memory.
variables gets initalized twice once with default value and other with user values.
inside referencevariable the values gets stored.
println and main are inbuilt methods.
members or building "blocks of class are variables , methods,blocks,constructor."

**3 Ways to initialize object
There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.
1.By reference variable
2.By method
3.By constructor

**There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:
1.By new keyword
2.By newInstance() method
3.By clone() method
4.By deserialization
5.By factory method etc.
